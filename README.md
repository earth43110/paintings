##Project Overview

Looking at a database of museum paintings, uses SQL queries to pull information. 

##Database Overview

Contains tables artist, canvas_size, completedacct, completedcard, museum, museum_hours, product_size, subject, work.

##Questions

1. What museums have the highest proportion of cubist paintings? What other styles of art do these museums typically display? 

2. Which artists have their work displayed in museums in many different countries? 

3. Create a table that shows the most frequently painted subject for each style of painting, 
how many paintings there were for the most frequently painted subject in that style, 
how many paintings there are in that style overall, and the percent of paintings in that 
style with the most frequent subject. Exclude cases where there is no 
information on the subject of the painting. Format the table and copy it into the google doc.
